# Programmer-Tower-in-China
This was the final project I wrote for my object-oriented programming courses in my sophomore year. It was a game based on instructions and dialogues. You need to follow the instructions to successfully rescue the princesses and win their love. This game alludes to the inhumane 996 work schedule of the programmers in some companies of China and calls for reformation. 
I developed this on the Xcode platform and the executable file generated merely applies to macOS, so I didn't upload it. You can generate one yourself.
All .h files, .c files were uploaded.
